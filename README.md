Build an NFT COllection which is later to be governed by Community

Development Path:

You are launching your NFT collection named Crypto Devs. You want to give your early supporters access to a whitelist for your collection, so here you are creating a whitelist dapp for Crypto Devs

There should be a website where people can go and enter into the whitelist.
